## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Commands to Execute

### 1. Set up PlatformNorthStar Structure

```bash
cd /Users/binghzal/Developer/PlatformNorthStar

# Create application categories
mkdir -p applications/{web-services,apis,databases,background-jobs}
mkdir -p applications/web-services/sample-web-app
mkdir -p applications/apis/sample-api
mkdir -p applications/databases/postgresql
mkdir -p applications/background-jobs/sample-worker

# Create Helm chart templates
mkdir -p charts/{app-template,database-template,api-template,web-template}

# Create additional environment directories
mkdir -p environments/{staging,prod}
mkdir -p environments/staging/{applications,values,config}
mkdir -p environments/prod/{applications,values,config}

# Create scripts directory
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p docs/{guides,references,troubleshooting}
```

### 2. Create Basic Application Templates

```bash
# Initialize Helm charts
helm create charts/app-template
helm create charts/database-template
helm create charts/api-template
helm create charts/web-template
```

### 3. Set up Environment Configurations

```bash
# Copy dev configuration as template for other environments
cp -r environments/dev environments/staging
cp -r environments/dev environments/prod

# Create configuration validation scripts
touch scripts/{validate-config.sh,deploy-app.sh,promote-env.sh}
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```
