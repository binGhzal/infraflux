# Recipes

This folder contains reusable bundles applied by Flux. Each bundle is a plain Kustomize directory in `recipes/<bundle>`.

Per-cluster synchronization manifests are generated by the CLI under
`out/<cluster>/recipes/` as Flux Kustomizations that reference these paths and
depend on `base` where appropriate.

- base: cert-manager, ExternalDNS, storage
- observability: kube-prometheus-stack, Grafana dashboards, etc
- devtools: Argo CD and common tools
