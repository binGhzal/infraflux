# Implement feature end-to-end (Terraform/K8s)

First perform RESEARCH:

1. Use MCP: context7.search("<topic>"), deepwiki.search("<topic>").
2. Summarize 3â€“6 relevant citations with URLs/titles.
3. List common errors/pitfalls and mitigations.

Then PLAN: 4) Write a step plan with checks after each step. 5) Call out file paths to change and new files to add.

Then IMPLEMENT: 6) Edit files. Keep commits small and labeled. 7) Run: terraform fmt/validate, tflint, helm/kube dry-runs as applicable.

Then VERIFY: 8) Explain test coverage added; paste key test outputs.

Then DOCUMENT: 9) Update docs; add a Mermaid diagram and short PR summary.
