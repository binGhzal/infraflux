This repository uses EditorConfig, Prettier, Markdownlint, and yamllint to keep formatting
consistent across languages.

- EditorConfig: universal whitespace and indent settings.
- Prettier: formats Markdown/JSON/HTML/CSS/JS, with proseWrap for Markdown.
- Markdownlint: enforces content rules; line-length disabled to defer to Prettier.
- yamllint: validates YAML style with 2-space indents; ignores generated site/.

Generated artifacts under `site/` are excluded from all linters.
